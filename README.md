## Challenges
I didn't have much issue with this homework. The only problem I had, was with the padding of the support button in the footer.
## Takeaway
Overall this homework was a alot less painful than I initally thought it was going to be. I believe I am starting to understand how to override bootstrap css classes.  

I would give this homework a 7/10.
